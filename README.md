# MATLAB-Simulation-of-Ultra-wideband-Transmission-and-Reception
This work is segmented in two main parts as stated in problem statement. The first part mainly deliberates the process of Transmitted Reference of Ultra Wide Band (TR-UWB) signal. This baseband signal encompasses multiple Scholtzâ€™s Monocycle pulses representing the coded binary sequence of message, which is later modulated with a cosine carrier at a given frequency. The second part is meant for reception simulation in which the received signal is processed and decoded, as well as analysed by several parameter adjustments.
